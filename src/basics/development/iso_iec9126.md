# Developer Basics: ISO/IEC 9126

ISO/IEC 9126 is a international standard for product quality in Software
Engineering. It was officially replaced by the new ISO/IEC 25010 in 2011
that introduces a few minor changes.

Software development, as any other activities carried out by human beings
is subject to human biases. The ISO/IEC 9126 standard's objective is that of
aknowledging the most common biases and addressing them by definining clear
guidelines about what properties a **good** software product should have.

In this section, we are not going to dive into this standard, but we strongly
believe that such standard (and its successor ISO/IEC 25010) should be the
best friend of any developer.

Throughout this book, we will mention some of these qualities as we motivate
some of the decisions made while creating the Duckietown Development Workflow.
