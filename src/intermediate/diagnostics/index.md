# Intermediate - Diagnostics

One of the strengths of Duckietown is that of allowing complex 
(sometimes state-of-the-art) algorithms to run on low-end computing
devices like the Raspberry Pi.
Unfortunately, low-end devices are not famous for their computational
power, so we developers have to be smart about the way we use the 
resources available.

The Duckietown Diagnostics tool provides a simple way of _recording_ 
the status of a system during an _experiment_.
The easiest way to think about it is that of an observer taking snapshots 
of the status of our system at regular temporal intervals.
