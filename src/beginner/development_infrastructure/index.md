(basic-structure)=
## Basic Project Structure
In Duckietown, everything runs in Docker containers. All you need in order to run a piece of software that uses ROS in Duckietown is a Duckietown-compliant Docker image with your software in it.

A boilerplate is provided [here](https://github.com/duckietown/template-ros). The repository contains a lot of files, but do not worry, we will analyze them one by one.

### Create a new repository

Click on the green button that says "Use this template".

```{figure} ../../_images/beginner/use_this_template.png
:name: use-this-template
```


This will take you to a page that looks like the following:

```{figure} ../../_images/beginner/create_a_repo_2.png
:name: create-repo
```

Pick a name for your repository (say `my-ros-program`) and press the button *Create repository from template*. Note, you can replace `my-ros-program` with the name of the repository that you prefer, make sure you use the right name in the instructions below.

This will create a new repository and copy everything from the repository `template-ros` to your new repository. You can now open a terminal and clone your newly created repository.

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-ros-program
    cd my-ros-program

```{attention}
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the link above with your GitHub username.
```

### Configure the repository

The repository contains already everything you need to create a Duckietown-compliant Docker image for your ROS program. The only thing we need to change before we can build an image from this repository is the repository name in the file `Dockerfile`. Open it using the text editor you prefer and change the first line from:

    ARG REPO_NAME="<REPO_NAME_HERE>"

to

  ARG REPO_NAME="my-ros-program"

Similarly, update the `DESCRIPTION` and `MAINTAINER` ARGs.

Then save the changes.

### Build the software image

We can now build the image, even though there won't be much going on inside it until we place our code in it.

To build, open a terminal and move to the directory created by the git clone instruction above. Run the following 
command:


    dts devel build -f

```{note}
If the above command is not recognized, you will first have to install it with `dts install devel`.
```

If you correctly installed Docker and the *duckietown-shell*, you should see a long log that ends with something like 
the following:

```{figure} ../../_images/beginner/docker_build.png
:name: docker-build
```

You can now run your container by executing the following command.


    dts devel run


This will show the following message:

```
The environment variable VEHICLE_NAME is not set. Using '![LAPTOP_HOSTNAME]'.
WARNING: robot_type file does not exist. Using 'duckiebot' as default type.
WARNING: robot_configuration file does not exist.
= Launching app...
This is an empty launch script. Update it to launch your application.
= App terminated!
```

```{admonition} CONGRATULATIONS ðŸŽ‰
You just built and run your first ROS-based Duckietown-compliant Docker image.
```

(ros-pub-laptop)=
## ROS Publisher on Laptop

Now that we know how to build a Docker image for Duckietown, letâ€™s put some code in one of them. We will see how to write a simple ROS program with Python, but any language supported by ROS should do it.

### Create a new ROS package

Open a terminal and go to the directory `my-ros-program` created above. In ROS, every ROS node must belong to a ROS _package_. ROS packages are placed inside the directory `packages` in `my-ros-program`. Let go ahead and create a directory called `my_package` inside `packages`.

    mkdir -p ./packages/my_package

A ROS package is simply a directory containing two special files, `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt`. So, letâ€™s turn the `my_package` folder into a ROS package by creating these two files.

Create the file `package.xml` inside `my_package` using your favorite text editor and place/adjust the following content inside it:

```xml
<package>
  <name>my_package</name>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <description>
  This package is a test for RH3.
  </description>
  <maintainer email="YOUR_EMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM">YOUR_FULL_NAME</maintainer>
  <license>None</license>

  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
</package>
```

Create the file `CMakeLists.txt` inside `my_package` using your favorite text editor and place/adjust the following content inside it:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(my_package)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  rospy
)

catkin_package()
```

### Create the publisher node

Now that we have a ROS package, we can create a ROS node inside it. Create the directory `src` inside `my_package` and use your favorite text editor to create the file `./packages/my_package/src/my_publisher_node.py` and place the following code inside it:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import rospy
from duckietown.dtros import DTROS, NodeType
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MyPublisherNode(DTROS):

    def __init__(self, node_name):
        # initialize the DTROS parent class
        super(MyPublisherNode, self).__init__(node_name=node_name, node_type=NodeType.GENERIC)
        # construct publisher
        self.pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size=10)

    def run(self):
        # publish message every 1 second
        rate = rospy.Rate(1) # 1Hz
        while not rospy.is_shutdown():
            message = "Hello World!"
            rospy.loginfo("Publishing message: '%s'" % message)
            self.pub.publish(message)
            rate.sleep()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # create the node
    node = MyPublisherNode(node_name='my_publisher_node')
    # run node
    node.run()
    # keep spinning
    rospy.spin()
```

And donâ€™t forget to declare the file `my_publisher_node.py` as an executable, by running the command:

    chmod +x ./packages/my_package/src/my_publisher_node.py


### Launch the publisher

We now need to tell Docker we want this script to be the one executed when we run the command `docker run ...`. In order to do so, open the file `./launchers/default.sh` and replace the line

    dt-exec echo "This is an empty launch script. Update it to launch your application."


with the following lines

```
roscore &
sleep 5
dt-exec rosrun my_package my_publisher_node.py
```

Let us now re-build the image

    dts devel build -f

```{note}
It is a good idea to make sure that the base image (`dt-ros-commons` in this case) is up to date. You can 
do so by adding the flag `--pull` to the command above, i.e., `dts devel build -f --pull`.
```

and run it

    dts devel run

This will show the following message:

```
The environment variable VEHICLE_NAME is not set. Using 'b17d5c5d1855'.

(ros-pub-duckiebot)=
## ROS Publisher on Duckiebot

Now that we know how to package a piece of software into a Docker image for Duckietown, we can go one step further and write code that will run on the robot instead of our laptop.

This part assumes that you have a Duckiebot up and running with hostname `MY_ROBOT`. Of course, you donâ€™t need to change the hostname to `MY_ROBOT`, just replace it with your robot name in the instructions below. You can make sure that your robot is ready by executing the command

    ping MY_ROBOT.local

If you can ping the robot, you are good to go.

Let us go back to our node file `my_node.py` and change the line:

```python
message = "Hello World!"
```

to,

```python
message = "Hello from %s" % os.environ['VEHICLE_NAME']
```


Since `roscore` is already running on the Duckiebot, we need to _remove_ the following lines from `launch.sh`:

```
roscore &
sleep 5
```

We can now slightly modify the instructions for building the image so that the image gets built directly on the robot instead of your laptop or desktop machine. Run the command:

    dts devel build -f -H ![MY_ROBOT].local

As you can see, we added the argument `-H ![MY_ROBOT].local`, which tells Docker to build the image on your `![MY_ROBOT]` instead of your laptop or desktop machine.

Once the image is built, we can run it on the robot by running the command:

    dts devel run -H ![MY_ROBOT].local

If everything worked as expected, you should see the following output,

```
The environment variable VEHICLE_NAME is not set. Using 'riplbot01'.

[INFO] [1569609194.749195]: Publishing message: 'Hello from riplbot01'
```

```{admonition} CONGRATULATIONS ðŸŽ‰
You just built and run your first Duckietown-compliant and Duckiebot-compatible ROS publisher.
```

(ros-sub-duckiebot)=
## ROS Subscriber on Duckiebot

Now that we know how to create a simple publisher, let's create a subscriber which can receive these messages.

### Create the subscriber node

Let us go back to our `src` folder and create a file called `my_subscriber_node.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import rospy
from duckietown.dtros import DTROS, NodeType
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MySubscriberNode(DTROS):

    def __init__(self, node_name):
        # initialize the DTROS parent class
        super(MySubscriberNode, self).__init__(node_name=node_name, node_type=NodeType.GENERIC)
        # construct publisher
        self.sub = rospy.Subscriber('chatter', String, self.callback)

    def callback(self, data):
        rospy.loginfo("I heard %s", data.data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # create the node
    node = MySubscriberNode(node_name='my_subscriber_node')
    # keep spinning
    rospy.spin()

```

### Launch the subscriber

Once again, donâ€™t forget to declare the file `my_subscriber_node.py` as an executable, by running the command:

    chmod +x ./packages/my_package/src/my_subscriber_node.py

Then add the following line in `./launchers/default.sh`

    dt-exec rosrun my_package my_subscriber_node.py

after

    dt-exec rosrun my_package my_publisher_node.py

Build the image on your Duckiebot again using

    dts devel build -f -H MY_ROBOT.local

Once the image is built, we can run it on the robot by running the command

    dts devel run -H MY_ROBOT.local

You should see the following output

```
[INFO] [1569750046.911664]: [/my_publisher_node] Initializing...
[INFO] [1569750046.914195]: [/my_subscriber_node] Initializing...

[INFO] [1569750047.928526]: I heard Hello from riplbot01
[INFO] [1569750048.926269]: Publishing message: 'Hello from riplbot01'

```

```{admonition} CONGRATULATIONS ðŸŽ‰
You just built and run your first Duckietown-compliant and Duckiebot-compatible ROS subscriber.
```

---

As a fun exercise, open a new terminal and run (without stopping the other process


    dts start_gui_tools ![MY_ROBOT]

and then inside it, run

    rqt_graph


Have you seen a graph like this before?

(ros-launch)=
## Launch files

You edited the `launch.sh` file to remove `roscore` when it was already running. What if there was something which 
starts a new `rosmaster` when it doesn't exist?

You also added multiple `rosrun` commands to run the publisher and subscriber. Now imagine writing similar shell scripts for programming multiple robot behaviors. Some basic nodes such as a camera or a motor driver will be running in all operation scenarios of your Duckiebot, but other nodes will be added/removed to run specific behaviors (e.g. lane following with or without obstacle avoidance). You can think of this as a hierarchy where certain branches are activated optionally.

You can obviously write a "master" `launch.sh` which executes other shell scripts for hierarchies. How do you pass parameters between these scripts? Where do you store all of them? What if you want to use packages created by other people?

ROS again saves the day by providing us with a tool that handles all this! This tool is called [roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch).


In this section, you will see how to use a ROS launch file to start both the publisher and subscriber together.

Create a folder called `launch` inside your package and then create a file inside the folder called `multiple_nodes.launch` with the following content

```xml
<launch>

  <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node" output="screen"/>
  <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node"  output="screen"/>

</launch>
```


Then replace the following lines inside `launch.sh` file

```
rosrun my_package my_node.py &
rosrun my_package my_node_subscriber.py
```

with

    roslaunch my_package multiple_nodes.launch

Build and run the image again like above. You should get the same result.

You can read more about how to interpret launch files [here](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML).

(ros-namespace-remap)=
## Namespaces and Remapping

If you went through the above link on launch files, you might have come across the terms namespaces and remapping. Understanding namespaces and remapping is very crucial to working with large ROS software stacks.


Consider you have two Duckiebots - `donald` and `daisy`. You want them to communicate with each other so that you use 
one `rosmaster` for both the robots. You have two copies of the same node running on each of them which grabs images from the camera and publishes them on a topic called `/image`. Do you see a problem here? Would it not be better if they were called `/donald/image` and `/daisy/image`? Here `donald` and `daisy` are ROS namespaces.


What if you were dealing with a robot which has two cameras? The names `/daisy/camera_left/image` and `/daisy/camera_right/image` are definitely the way to go. You should also be able to do this without writing a new Python file for the second camera.    

Let's see how we can do this. First of all, we need to make sure that all the topics used by your Duckiebot are within its namespace.

Edit the `./packages/my_package/launch/multiple_nodes.launch` to look like this:

```xml
<launch>

  <group ns="$(arg veh)">  

    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node" output="screen"/>
    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node"  output="screen"/>

  </group>

</launch>
```

Then edit the roslaunch command in `./launch.sh` as follows:

    roslaunch my_package multiple_nodes.launch veh:=$VEHICLE_NAME

Build and run the image. Once again run `rqt_graph` like above. What changed?

As a next step, we need to ensure that we can launch multiple instances of the same node with different names, and publishing topics corresponding to those names. For example, running two camera nodes with names `camera_left` and `camera_right` respectively, publishing topics `/my_robot/camera_left/image` and `/my_robot/camera_right/image`.

Notice how the `node` tag in the launch file has a `name` attribute. You can have multiple `node` tags with different names for the same python node file. The name provided here will override the name you give inside the python file for the node.

Edit the `./packages/my_package/launch/multiple_nodes.launch` file to have two publishers and two subscribers as below:

```xml
<launch>

  <group ns="$(arg veh)">  

    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node_1" output="screen"/>
    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node_2" output="screen"/>
    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen"/>
    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_2"  output="screen"/>

   </group>

</launch>
```

Check `rqt_graph`. All communications are happening on one topic. You still cannot differentiate between topics being published by multiple nodes. Turns out doing that is very simple. Open the file `./packages/my_package/src/my_publisher_node.py` and edit the declaration of the publisher from

```python
...
        self.pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size=10)
...
```

to

```python
...
        self.pub = rospy.Publisher('~chatter', String, queue_size=10)
...
```

All we did was add a tilde(`~`) sign in the beginning of the topic. Names that start with a `~` in ROS are private names. They convert the node's name into a namespace. Note that since the nodes are already being launched inside the namespace of the robot, the node's namespace would be nested inside it. Read more about private namespaces [here](http://wiki.ros.org/Names)

Do this for the subscriber node as well. Run the experiment and observe `rqt_graph` again. This time, switch the 
graph type from `Nodes only` to `Nodes/Topics (all)` and uncheck `Hide: Dead sinks` and `Hide: Leaf topics`. Play with these two "Hide" options to see what they mean.

All looks very well organized, except that no nodes are speaking to any other node. This is where the magic of remapping begins.

Edit the `./packages/my_package/launch/multiple_nodes.launch` file to contain the following:

```xml
<launch>

  <group ns="$(arg veh)">  

    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node_1" output="screen"/>
    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_publisher_node.py" name="my_publisher_node_2" output="screen"/>

    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen">
        <remap from="~/chatter" to="/$(arg veh)/my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
    </node>

    <node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_2"  output="screen">
        <remap from="~/chatter" to="/$(arg veh)/my_publisher_node_2/chatter"/>
    </node>

   </group>

</launch>
```

Check `rqt_graph`. Does it make sense?

Now, replace

```xml
<node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen">
    <remap from="~/chatter" to="/$(arg veh)/my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
</node>
```

with

```xml
<node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen">
    <remap from="~/chatter" to="my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
</node>
```

Does it still work? Why?

How about if you replace it with this:

```xml
<node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen">
    <remap from="~/chatter" to="/my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
</node>
```

How about this?

```xml
<remap from="my_subscriber_node_1/chatter" to="my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
<node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen"/>
```

Or this?

```xml
<remap from="~my_subscriber_node_1/chatter" to="~my_publisher_node_1/chatter"/>
<node pkg="my_package" type="my_subscriber_node.py" name="my_subscriber_node_1"  output="screen"/>
```

Can you explain why some of them worked, while some did not?


(ros-multi-agent)=
## Multi-agent Communication

In this subsection, you will learn how to communicate between your laptop and the Duckiebot using ROS. Start by 
verifying that _Portainer_ is running.

Next, ping your Duckiebot to find its IP address:

    ping MY_ROBOT.local

Note down the address. Next, find the IP address of your computer. Note that you may have multiple IP addresses depending on how many networks you are connected to. If you have a Linux computer, you can find your IP using:

    ifconfig

From the output, extract the IP address of the interface from which you are connected to your Duckiebot. For example, if you and your Duckiebot are both connected through WiFi, find your IP address from the WiFi connection.

Run the following command:

    docker run -it --rm --net host duckietown/dt-ros-commons:daffy /bin/bash

Right now, you are inside a ROS-enabled container which is connected to the `rosmaster` running on your laptop. But you want to connect to the `rosmaster` on your duckiebot. To do this, inside the container, run:

    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://![MY_ROBOT_IP]:11311/
    export ROS_IP=![MY_IP]

Replace `MY_ROBOT_IP` and `MY_IP` with the IP addresses extracted above, in that order. More information about these environment variables [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables).

Now, run:

    rostopic list

You should see topics from your Duckiebot appearing here. VoilÃ ! You have successfully established connection between your laptop and Duckiebot through ROS!

```{tip}
If the `11311` above seems confusing, no need to worry! This is simply the default port number that ROS 
uses for communication. You can change it for any other free port.
```
