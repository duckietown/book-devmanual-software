## Topic and message type of interest

As you should know by now, ROS allows different processes to communicate with one another by exchanging
_messages_ over _topics_. In order for two ROS nodes to be able to talk, they need to agree on a topic
name (e.g., camera images), and a message type (e.g., each message is a JPEG image).

In ROS, a topic is identified by a string (e.g., `camera/image`), while message types are defined using
the [official messages description language](http://wiki.ros.org/msg).

In the case of the camera sensor, the topic used by the Duckiebot to publish camera frames 
is `/ROBOT_NAME/camera_node/image/compressed`, while the message type used over this topic is the standard 
[sensor_msgs/CompressedImage](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CompressedImage.html),
and contains the following fields.

```
std_msgs/Header header
string format
uint8[] data
```

where,
- `header`: is the [standard ROS header](https://wiki.ros.org/msg#Header) object;
- `format`: specifies the format of the data, for example, `png` or `jpeg`;
- `data`: is an array of bytes containing the actual image in the format specified;

## Create Subscriber ROS Node

In [](ros-catkin-package-create), we learned how to make a new Catkin package. We will assume that a
catkin package already exists, i.e., `packages/my_package/`. You can reuse the one we created earlier.

We now use our favorite text editor to create the file
`camera_reader_node.py` inside the `src/` directory of our catkin package and add the following content,

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import rospy
from duckietown.dtros import DTROS, NodeType
from sensor_msgs.msg import CompressedImage

import cv2
from cv_bridge import CvBridge

class CameraReaderNode(DTROS):

    def __init__(self, node_name):
        # initialize the DTROS parent class
        super(CameraReaderNode, self).__init__(node_name=node_name, node_type=NodeType.VISUALIZATION)
        # static parameters
        self._vehicle_name = os.environ['VEHICLE_NAME']
        self._camera_topic = f"/{self._vehicle_name}/camera_node/image/compressed"
        # bridge between OpenCV and ROS
        self._bridge = CvBridge()
        # create window
        self._window = "camera-reader"
        cv2.namedWindow(self._window, cv2.WINDOW_AUTOSIZE)
        # construct subscriber
        self.sub = rospy.Subscriber(self._camera_topic, CompressedImage, self.callback)

    def callback(self, msg):
        # convert JPEG bytes to CV image
        image = self._bridge.compressed_imgmsg_to_cv2(msg)
        # display frame
        cv2.imshow(self._window, image)
        cv2.waitKey(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # create the node
    node = CameraReaderNode(node_name='camera_reader_node')
    # keep spinning
    rospy.spin()
```

Again, we make our node executable,

    chmod +x ./packages/my_package/src/camera_reader_node.py



## Define launcher

Similarly to what we did in the section [](ros-sub-define-launcher), we create a new launcher file
`./launchers/camera-reader.sh` with the content,

```shell
#!/bin/bash

source /environment.sh

# initialize launch file
dt-launchfile-init

# launch subscriber
rosrun my_package camera_reader_node.py

# wait for app to end
dt-launchfile-join
```

Let us now re-compile our project using the command

    dts devel build -f



## Launch the node

We are now ready to run our camera reader node,

    dts devel run -R ROBOT_NAME -L camera-reader -X

This will open a new window like the following,

```{figure} ../../_images/beginner/ros/camera-reader-window-linux.jpg
:width: 100%
:name: fig:camera-reader-window

Camera feed window.
```

If you want to stop the node, just use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.


```{note}
We used the flag `-X` to instruct `dts` to allow this project to create new windows on this computer's screen.
```


```{attention}
The trick we learned in [](dtproject-ros-faster-development-trick-run-locally) to speed up our development
workflow becomes mandatory here. In fact, this particular node needs access to a screen to be able to open
the window showing the camera feed, hence the need to run it locally as the Duckiebot is not connected to 
a monitor.
You can put this to the test by attempting to build and run this node 
on the Duckiebot (using the `-H ROBOT_NAME`) flag, you will be presented the error `cannot open display`.
```


```{todo}
Add section back in the Basic part of this book where we explain what the `-X` flag does in `dts devel run`.
Once done, update NOTE above to recall where we learned this.
```


```{admonition} Congratulations ðŸŽ‰
You just built and run your first ROS node connected to the existing ROS network exposed by the Duckiebot.
```
